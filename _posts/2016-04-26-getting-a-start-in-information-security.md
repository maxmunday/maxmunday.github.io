Trust your technolust...

I like information security, I like it so much I decided to make it my career. 

So I read as much as I could about the different roles, and what I needed to do to make a start in the field. I decided to focus on offensive security, as it is what I enjoy the most and it seems like an interesting place to start.


The advice I read all pointed toward the need for a good foundation in three areas: 


\* system administration

\* networking

\* programming

In addition several people suggested getting a head start on offensive security concepts alongside the basics.


So, that is what I focused on for my self-study. Formal study, certifications and work experience will round it out properly in the near future.


This is what I have worked through so far, with some included resources. Of course this is still an ongoing work in progress.
