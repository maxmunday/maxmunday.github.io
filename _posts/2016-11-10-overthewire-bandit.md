This is my write-up of the [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org) wargame [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). This is a Bash command line wargame aimed at newcomers. Although I have done this before, I recently ran through it again with the [Swinburne University Cyber Security Club](http://scsc.wtf/) and thought it would be a good idea to do a write-up. If you notice any problems please [contact](/contact) me to let me know.
