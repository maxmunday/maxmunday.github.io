\-\-[ Basics ]


The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I use Markdown to author my posts.

Some helpful tutorials were Jonathan McGlone's [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), Thinkful's [guide](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/), and this Markdown [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). This [guide](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/setting-up-custom-domain-github-pages/) and this [guide](https://www.goyllo.com/github/pages/free-cloudflare-ssl-for-custom-domain/) helped with setting up a custom domain with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) security features.

The documentation for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) is also very helpful.

View the source code for my site [here](https://github.com/maxmunday/maxmunday.github.io). Feel free to use this for your own project or however you wish.
