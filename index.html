    <p>I am a student programmer, penetration tester, and information security obsessive. I am a Linux and sci-fi enthusiast, and an avid outdoorsman.</p> 

    <p>I am an experienced security and risk professional having planned and led combat and intelligence missions on multiple operations during over a decade with the Australian Army.</p> 

    <p>I am currently undertaking a Masters in Information Technology (Security) at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia. However, I get the most out of self-learning. I am documenting some of my learning in <a href="/blog">my blog.</a></p>
